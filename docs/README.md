A library to easily make sounds with a Buzzer.

*This library is currently under development. Fixes and new features as well as support for more platforms will be included in further releases. If you find any issue please report it in the issues section.*



## Supported Platforms

Currently only supports the `Esp32` platform. 

Support for this others platforms will be added `Arduino`  `Particle Photon`  `Particle Electron`

## Getting Started

##### Include the library in the sketch

`#include <EasyBuzzer.h>`

##### Run the library

``` c++
void loop() {
	// Always call this function in the loop for EasyBuzzer to work.
	EasyBuzzer.update();
}
```



## Uses

#### Beep Once  

`EasyBuzzer.beep()`

Use this function to make a single beep at given frequency. Note that you have to use a callback function to stop the beeping sound of the buzzer.

```c++
// This function will be called when the beeping sequence ends.
void finished() {
  // This function stop the beeping.
  EasyBuzzer.stopBeep();
};
// Beep once.
EasyBuzzer.beep(
  1000,		// Beep's frequency.
  100,		// On duration.
  finished	// A function to call when the beep ends.
);
```

#### Beep Sequence 

`EasyBuzzer.beepSequence()`

Use this function to create a sequence of beeps at a given frequency. 

```c++
// Start a beeping sequence
EasyBuzzer.beepSequence(
  1000,		// Beep's frequency.
  50,		// On duration.
  100,		// Off duration.
  2,		// Cycles.
  500,		// Pause duration.
  1,      	// Sequences.
  NULL		// [Optional] A function to call when the sequence ends.
);
```

#### Beep Sequence With A Callback

`EasyBuzzer.beepSequence()`

Use this function to create a sequence of beeps at a given frequency and make a call to a given function when the sequence ends.

```c++
// This function will be called when the beeping sequence ends.
void finished() {
  Serial.println("Done!");
};
// Start a beeping sequence.
EasyBuzzer.beepSequence(
  1000,		// Beep's frequency.
  50,		// On duration.
  100,		// Off duration.
  2,		// The number of beeps per cycle.
  500,		// Pause duration.
  10,		// The number of cycle.
  finished	// [Optional] A function to call when the sequence ends.
);
```
